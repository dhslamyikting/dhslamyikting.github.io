<h2>My CCA</h2>Club
  <h1>Infocomm Club</h1>
<p>I hope that and I believe that with my hard work,  in the future, I can use coding to build an app or program that impacts the world or the society. I see many problems that we face in my daily life and I really want to strive to make a difference to the world. Thatâ€™s why I joined the Infocomm Club! I feel passion to use technology and advance forward; a need to help others improve their quality of living; a want to make a difference to many people in the world.
<br>
I want to take this step by step. I want to lay the very basic foundations of coding before I start slowly to create my app, slowly designing it and improving it before releasing it out to people all over the world. Currently, I am undergoing a course hosted by Apple, teaching us the basics and steps of coding an app using Swift, a programming language, before allowing us to create our own app and upload it onto the App Store. I certainly do not mind spending my Saturdays attending this course; it really sparks my interest to do more! I wish to gather feedback from others to improve my app; so that it is user-friendly but at the same time very convenient and useful. I have always thought of the big companies like WhatsApp or YouTube; which have set the standard of communication and video streaming apps, and I hope one day, I can be the creator of such popular apps. I shall work hard towards my goal in order to achieve it and I believe that I can do it!
