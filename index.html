<h2>Hey There.</h2>
  <img src="442ADBBD-1F2D-4477-8E23-EEFB1BFCD55A.jpg" height=300 width=220>
  <h1>This is me.</h1>
<p>I'm from Dunman High School and Hereâ€™s my school website link <a href ="www.dhs.sg"> Dunman High School  </a>. </p>

<h2>My Interests</h2>
  <p>I am in the Infocomm Club. I love to code and I hope in the future I get to create an app that impacts the world. I also like to photograph; this is my favourite photo:</p>
  #borderimg { 
    border-image: img src="20170424_191702.jpg" 30 round;
}
  <br>
    <p>I also hope to be a good leader. I was the head prefect in my Primary School and hosted skits. I have surely learnt a lot more from my experiences.
